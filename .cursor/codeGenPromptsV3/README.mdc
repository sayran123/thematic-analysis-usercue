General concepts:
- I want to implement a phase, test it using the file and make sure the output is what I am expecting
- For llm responses I want to implement one agent run the system, validate the output and then move on to the next step/next agent in the process 
- I don’t want to run all 6 questions concurrently. I want to run one question validate that I can get it to work then once that’s complete then ill implement the parallelization code.
